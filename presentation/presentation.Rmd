# Current options for <br> interactive viz in R

---

class: middle

- <b> Older generation</b>: iPlots, Acinonyx, RGGobi/GGobi
  - Good but may not work with newer R installations
- <b> Newer generation</b>: ggplotly, ggiraph, ggvis, RJSplot,... 
  - Many more based on D3.js and plotly (many specialized)
  - Popular but have some problems/shortcomings

# Problems

---

class: middle

- <b> Built for static viz first, interactive second </b>
  - A lot of "interactivity" happens within one plot, linking several plots together is convoluted 
- <b> Designed for presentation, not EDA </b>
  - i.e. made for dashboards
  - Long set up time: not ideal for EDA
  - SVG-based: looks pretty but slow at high data volumes
- <b> Lack of adherence to data viz principles </b> 
  - Chartjunk: redundant elements of plot that distract from the data (Tufte, 1983)
  - Interactive chartjunk: useless interactivity that distracts from the data

# Solution

---

class: middle

- <b>Master's project</b>
  - Lay foundations for a general-purpose interactive viz library/package, designed with interactivity-first & principled data viz mindset
- <b>Back-end written in TypeScript</b> 
  - (a fancier, typed version of JavaScript)
  - Portable: should run anywhere
  - Should be better maintainable than plain Javascript
- <b>Uses HTML canvas element</b>
  - Bitmap: a lot faster than SVG
